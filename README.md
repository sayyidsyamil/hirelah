## 1. Introduction
Hirela AI is an AI-powered recruitment platform designed for Southeast Asia, streamlining the hiring process for both candidates and recruiters. The platform leverages explainable AI to match candidates to jobs, automate resume screening, and conduct virtual interviews, making talent acquisition faster, fairer, and more efficient. Key features include AI-driven resume parsing, semantic candidate search, live and virtual AI interviews, and recruiter-candidate chatbots. The system is built with modern web technologies and integrates Google Gemini for advanced AI analysis.

## 2. Problem Statement
Traditional recruitment is time-consuming, biased, and often inefficient, especially in fast-growing markets like Southeast Asia. Recruiters struggle to sift through large volumes of resumes, while candidates face generic application processes. This leads to poor job matches, longer hiring cycles, and missed opportunities. According to LinkedIn, 67% of recruiters say AI saves them time, but most solutions lack transparency and local context.

## 3. Aim and Objectives
Aim: To build an explainable, AI-powered recruitment platform that accelerates and improves talent matching for Southeast Asia.
### Objectives:
- Automate resume parsing and candidate profiling using AI.
- Enable semantic search and filtering of talent pools for recruiters.
- Provide AI-powered, bias-reduced virtual interviews.
- Offer live chat and Q&A with AI for both recruiters and candidates.
- Ensure explainability and transparency in all AI-driven decisions.

## 4. Methodology
### 4.1 Implementation
- Prototype Development: Built core flows for candidate onboarding, recruiter search, and AI interview.
- Implementation: Integrated Google Gemini for resume analysis, Next.js for frontend/backend, and Clerk for authentication.
- Testing & Refinement: User testing with sample resumes, iterative UI/UX improvements, and AI output validation.

### 4.2 Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Next.js API routes, Node.js
- Database: JSON-based (for prototype), can be extended to MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- AI/ML: Google Gemini API (resume parsing, semantic search, interview Q&A)
- Authentication: Clerk
- Deployment: Vercel

## 5. Potential Impact
### 5.1 Market Research
Competitors: Seek, JobStreet, Glints, LinkedIn Talent Solutions. Existing solutions focus on job listings or basic AI matching, often lacking explainability and local adaptation. Hirela AI is unique in its use of explainable AI, live chat, and virtual interviews tailored for Southeast Asia.

### 5.2 Target Users
- Recruiters/HR teams in Southeast Asia seeking efficient, bias-reduced hiring.
- Job seekers wanting personalized, fairer job matching and feedback.
